# Using Interactive Technology to Teach Basic Algorithmic Instructions

## Description
* Difficulty Level: Easy
* Target Audience: Elementary - College
* Duration of workshop: 30 - 60 minutes
* Needed Material: Cozmos, Cozmo app, One cube that comes with Cozmo, Phones or tablets with wifi connection, a maze
* The primary goal of this project is educating others about algorithms by programming a robot through a maze using the Cozmo app. 
* Cozmo is a small robot that reacts to its enviornment and moves around by code you create in the app. 
The focus of the project is to teach students what an algorithm is and how it works while using interactive technology to pique their interest.
The students will be asked to write a program that navigates a Cozmo inside a maze, retrieves a block, and returns it to the user.
* The Technology Ambassador Program ([TAP](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

## Setup and Installtion

1. Download the Cozmo App (it can be found on the Google Play store and the Apple store).
2. Connect to Cozmo through its wifi (move its lift up and down and the wifi password will appear).
3. You should be connected to Cozmo now!

## How to run it / Usage

Cozmo comes with a bunch of different activites that it is able to perform such as an Explorer Mode where the user can navigate it with the smart device connected, a visual progrramming mode where users are able to code Cozmo to do certain actions with block coding and much more.
