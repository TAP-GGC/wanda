# Using Interactive Technology to Teach Basic Algorithmic Instructions

## Description

Interactive technology can be used to teach programming concepts to students more easily. Technology can seem hard to understand and scare off students with little understanding of it. The Technical Ambassador Program introduces some basic concepts through new and exciting technologies to show people that technology can be fun. The focus of the project is to teach students what an algorithm is and how it works while using interactive technology to pique their interest. The students will be asked to write a program that navigates a Cozmo inside a maze, retrieves a block, and returns it to the user.
